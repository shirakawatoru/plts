# Personalized Logistic Thompson Sampling
This code for personalized logistic Thompson sampling (PLTS) solves a multi-armed bandit problem with many arms. The number of arms is supposed to be thousands. PLTS incorporates individual heterogeneous responses by hierarchical bayesian model. The implementation uses Laplace approximation in the Bayse update process. Mobile health is a good application area of PLTS.
